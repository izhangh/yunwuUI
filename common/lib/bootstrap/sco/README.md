# [Sco.js v1.1.0](http://terebentina.github.io/sco.js)

A collection of jQuery plugins for the web. Inspired by Twitter Bootstrap js components, Sco.js plugins can be used as replacement for the bootstrap js. You can find a different approach for some of the bootstrap js as well as
other plugins that don't exist in bootstrap. Sco.js uses much less HTML markup than bootstrap and provides sane and intuitive defaults for its options so that you can get started in no time.
It was created and is maintained by <a href="http://twitter.com/dancaragea">@dancaragea</a>.

## Looking for maintainers

The default branch was created for bootstrap 2. There's a bs3 branch where I adapted some of the tools to work with bootstrap 3 but it's not complete. Bootstrap 4 is now close to release. I moved away from jQuery lately and I don't have time to maintain this. I am happy for any PR requests and maintainers to take over. Let me know if you're interested.

## Quick start

You can get started by choosing one of the following options:

* [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/terebentina/sco.js/zipball/master) or pick the latest stable tag.
* Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/terebentina/sco.js.git`.
* Get the latest version with Bower: `bower install sco.js --save`.

## Versioning

Sco.js is versioned using the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) specification.
